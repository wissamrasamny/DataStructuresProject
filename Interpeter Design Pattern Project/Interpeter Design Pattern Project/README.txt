Students have no access to tutoring courses of courses they do not take, and those who are enrolled  in these courses wait for emails to access information about the tutoring sessions. 
Therefore this projects aim is to facilitate the access to the tutoring sessions held.  
The project was implemented using the html and css markup languages and the java script  programming language. 
The website has a main page which allows access for the navigation, to  the pages which store information regarding tutoring sessions. 
In order to run the code, open the Main.html file ,located in the CODE folder, with google chrome this will run the code locally on your google Chrome browser.


Note: Unfortunately we switched from Django to writing the code using only java script, due to unexpected failure in the integration of the codes due to using different operating systems. Consequently, the Django code, database, and the interepter design pattern weren't utilized in this demonstration due to the short period of time to re-implement the code. The interpreter design patter will be found in an Interpeter.py file in the python language.
